In this project, we successfully analyzed and visualized a dataset of movie ratings using Python. We explored the structure of the dataset, handled missing values, and applied both statistical and visual analysis to understand patterns in movie ratings. Through histograms, box plots, scatter plots, and bar charts, we identified trends such as top-rated movies, average ratings across genres, and correlations between IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes ratings. An interactive dashboard was also created, allowing dynamic exploration of the data by genre and rating filters. This project demonstrates how data exploration and visualization can provide meaningful insights and support decision-making in the film industry.
